.TH icebreaker 6 "v$VERSION: $VERDATE"
.SH NAME
icebreaker - An addictive action-puzzle game for X.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B icebreaker
.SH DESCRIPTION
So, uh, there's a bunch of penguins on an iceberg in Antarctica. You
have been selected to catch them so they can be shipped to Finland, where
they are essential to a secret plot for world domination.
.PP
In order to trap the penguins, you'll need to break the iceberg into small
chunks by melting lines without hitting any of the birds. Once 80% or more
of the 'berg is gone, you advance to the next level.
.PP
Use the left mouse button to start lines, and the right (and/or middle)
button to toggle between horizontal and vertical. Beyond that, it's probably
easier for you go figure out the game by playing than by reading. So go.
.PP
Go!
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-nosound
do not attempt to initialize sound system. Causes the in-game Sound option to
be marked N/A, and the config file setting to be ignored.
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-fullscreen
start in fullscreen mode if possible. Ignores config file setting.
.TP
.B \-w, \-\-windowed
start in windowed mode. Resets config file so that this is the default. You
probably won't ever need to use this, but it's there in case
fullscreen somehow is broken and you're too lazy to edit the config file
manually.
.TP
\fB\-t\fIthemename\fP, \fB\--theme=\fIthemename\fP
select theme \fIthemename\fR -- overrides config file. For more information
on themes, see README.themes or the IceBreaker web site.
