The easiest way to install this is via RPM. If the binary RPM doesn't work
on your system, or you don't trust it, just download the src.rpm and rebuild
it. (If you've never done that before, don't worry -- it's actually
amazingly easy -- just do "rpm --rebuild icebreaker.src.rpm".)

You can of course also install from Plain Old Source. You should be able to
just do "make", and then as root, "make install". You'll need the SDL
libraries from <http://www.libsdl.org/>, if you don't have them already.

Note that if you don't have the data files in the right place ("make
install" should do it), the game will crash ignominiously on startup.
