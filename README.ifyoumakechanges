IceBreaker is free software -- you're welcome to do anything you like with
it under the terms of the GNU GPL. However, as a courtesy, if you do make
changes to the code, packaging, themes, or whatever, I really would
appreciate it if you'd send me what you've done (e-mail <mattdm@mattdm.org>,
but check before sending binary attachments). That way, improvements can get
rolled into the main version and everyone can benefit. Thanks!
